Here is very basic web based wallet(Version1.0):
1. It generates seed phrase
2. Then generates Solana or eth wallets based on user input
3. Derives a new Solana wallet (keypair) and Eth wallet on each button click, so, it supports multiple addresses
4. Supports HD wallet functionality using BIP44 for Ethereum and solana

Used react for Frontend
